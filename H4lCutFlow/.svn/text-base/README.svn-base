   
Instruction to run the H4l cutflow code:

1) In a folder, setup Analysis release by doing:
    setupATLAS
    rcSetup Base,2.4.29
    (After the first time setting up the release, simply do "rcSetup")

2) Checkout the HZZCutCommon and H4lCutflow package

    If you want to use the trunk (This will change frequently, but will be up to date).
    rc checkout_pkg atlasoff/PhysicsAnalysis/HiggsPhys/Run2/HZZ/Minitrees/Common/trunk/HZZCutCommon
    rc checkout_pkg atlasoff/PhysicsAnalysis/HiggsPhys/Run2/HZZ/Minitrees/H4l/Primary/trunk/H4lCutFlow


    If you want to use a tagged version of the code (Way more stable),
    I would recommend using the latest tagged version of the code
    rc checkout_pkg atlasoff/PhysicsAnalysis/HiggsPhys/Run2/HZZ/Minitrees/Common/tags/Common-XX-YY-ZZ/HZZCutCommon
    rc checkout_pkg atlasoff/PhysicsAnalysis/HiggsPhys/Run2/HZZ/Minitrees/H4l/Primary/tags/Primary-XX-YY-ZZ/H4lCutFlow

3) Checkout the packages used by the H4lCutflow code
    rc checkout H4lCutFlow/Packages.txt

4) Compile the code
    rc find_packages
    rc compile

5) To run locally, simply do
    runAnalysis
    (Currently, the datasets and output file name are hardcode in the steering script. This will be updated soon)

    In the main directory, the output minitree will be created and saved

 6) To submit on the Grid, first checkout the Grid submission code
    rc checkout_pkg atlasoff/PhysicsAnalysis/HiggsPhys/Run2/HZZ/Minitrees/H4l/Primary/trunk/Grid

    * Note that this Grid package must reside at the same level as the H4lCutFlow. In other words, 
    it must be in the same directory that you run the code in *

    // Currently, note that Grid for mc15 has not been checked
    setup the local panda client and the voms-proxy

    cd Grid
    and in prunMyAnalysis.py, you can pick and choose what type of sample you want to run. 
    The list of samples is declared as vector inside another .py file and include in this one
    This is to aid in organization.
